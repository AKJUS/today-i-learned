# Ignore a typerscript error

Sometimes you just want typescript to ignore your errors, because you are used to working with javascript! Not exactly true but may be you have a dynamically generated file or a script with runs remotely and the variables are not available locally. 
Then just use this line to ignore the typerscript errors above your code:

```
// @ts-ignore
```
