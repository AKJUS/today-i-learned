Today I Learned - Sharing and documenting the things I learn on a daily basis. These are tiny things which make a big difference. Over the time they are lost and documenting them along the way would be beneficial for everyone. Contains a cat gif, because, cats make people happy. Scroll to the bottom, to see the cat gif. :D

## Inspiration
I shamelessly stole this idea from [wajahatkarim3/Today-I-Learned](https://github.com/wajahatkarim3/Today-I-Learned), then I also saw other similar repositories and decided to share my own repo of what I learn everyday.

## Contributing

The best way you can contribute is to support the idea of keeping track of things you learned. Just create a public repo and start writing and sharing notes. This is way better than keeping them to yourself.
