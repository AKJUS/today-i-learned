# Running NPM Scripts in Parallel or Sequentially

When working with Node.js projects, you might need to run multiple NPM scripts either in parallel or sequentially. Hereâ€™s how you can achieve both.

## Running Scripts Sequentially

To run scripts one after another, you can use the `&&` operator. For example:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "script1": "echo 'Running script 1'",
        "script2": "echo 'Running script 2'",
        "start": "npm run script1 && npm run script2"
    }
}
```

In this example, `script2` will only run after `script1` has completed successfully.

## Running Scripts in Parallel
To run scripts simultaneously, you can use the `&` operator. For example:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "script1": "echo 'Running script 1'",
        "script2": "echo 'Running script 2'",
        "start": "npm run script1 & npm run script2"
    }
}
```

In this example, `script1` and `script2` will run at the same time.

## Conclusion

Using these methods, you can easily manage the execution order of your NPM scripts to fit your project's needs.
